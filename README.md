# Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences

Hello, curious learner, and welcome to my [notes on Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences](https://github.com/thefundamentaltheor3m/IB_AS_GS_Notes/blob/main/TeX_Outputs/main.pdf).

My name is Sidharth Hariharan. I work part-time as an IB mathematics tutor with Lanterna Education, and am myself an IB alumnus and perfect scorer. I am pursuing an undergraduate degree in mathematics at Imperial College London, and also run [a fairly successful math account on Instagram](https://instagram.com/the_fundamental_theor3m).

I hope you find these notes useful! If you'd like to add anything, feel free to make a pull request, which I will review when I get a chance.

Happy learning!
