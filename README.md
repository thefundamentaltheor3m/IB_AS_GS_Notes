# Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences

Hello, curious learner, and welcome to my [notes on Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences](https://github.com/thefundamentaltheor3m/IB_AS_GS_Notes/blob/main/TeX_Outputs/main.pdf).

My name is Sidharth, and apart from being a part-time IB mathematics tutor with Lanterna Education, I am a full-time mathematics student at Imperial College London. I am myself an IB alumnus and perfect scorer.

I hope you find these notes useful! If you'd like to add anything, feel free to make a pull request, which I will review when I get a chance.

Happy learning!
