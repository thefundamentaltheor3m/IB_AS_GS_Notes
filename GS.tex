\section{Geometric Sequences}

\subsection{What is a Geometric Sequence?}

\begin{definition}[Geometric Sequence]
    A sequence $\an$ is said to be \textbf{geometric} if there exists some $r \in \R$ (called the \textbf{common ratio}) such that for all $n \in \N$,
    \begin{align}
        a_{n+1} &= r \cdot a_n
    \end{align}
\end{definition}
In other words, multiplying any term in the sequence by $r$ gives the next term.

\begin{boxexercise}[An Equivalent Characterisation]
    Let $\an$ be a geometric sequence. Show that the $n$th term $a_n$ of the sequence is given by
    \begin{align}
        a_n &= a_1 \cdot r^{n - 1}
    \end{align}
\end{boxexercise}

Observe the following.
\begin{boxhexercise} Let $\an$ be a geometric sequence with common ratio $r$. Show the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If any term is zero (ie, if $a_j = 0$ for some $j \in \N$), then \textit{every} term (except maybe $a_1$) is zero. In particular, every term after the $j$th term is zero.
    \item If $r = 1$, then the sequence is constant (ie, all the terms are equal).
\end{enumerate}
\end{boxhexercise}

Thus, if $\an$ is a geometric sequence with nonzero terms, we can see that for all $n \in \N$,
\begin{align}
    \frac{a_{n+2}}{a_{n+1}} &= \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}
\end{align}
Indeed, the ratio of any two successive terms is equal (and indeed, equal to $r$). This is a nice way to check if a sequence is geometric: if you have two pairs of consecutive terms whose ratios are not equal, then the sequence cannot be geometric in nature.

\subsection{Examples of Geometric Sequences}

Geometric Sequences are as common as arithmetic sequences, and again, we have all seen them in numerous forms, even if we have not always realised it.

\begin{example}
    Each of the following is an example of a geometric sequence.\footnote{As with Arithmetic Sequences, we do not distinguish the sequences (ie, the respective $\N \to \R$ maps) from their terms.}
    \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
        \item $3,6,12,24,\ldots$ form a geometric sequence with first term $3$ and common ratio $2$.
        \item $1,3,9,27,\ldots$ (ie, the powers of $3$) form a geometric sequence with first term $1$ and common ratio $3$. (Indeed, the powers of any number $x$ form a geometric sequence with first term $1$, corresponding to the zeroth power, and common ratio $x$.)
        \item $0,0,0,0,\ldots$ form a geometric sequence with first term $0$ and arbitrary common ratio.
        \item For any number $x \in \R$, the sequence $x,x,x,x,\ldots$ is geometric, with first term $x$ and common ratio $1$.
        \item $1,0,0,0,\ldots$ form a geometric sequence with first term $1$ and common ratio $0$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\begin{boxhexercise}[The Relationship Between Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences]
\hfill
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find an example of a sequence $\an$ that is both arithmetic and geometric in nature.
    \item Can you think of a way to convert any arithmetic sequence into a geometric sequence and any geometric sequence into an arithmetic sequence?
    \begin{hint}
        Can you think of a natural way of converting addition into multiplication? That is, can you think of a function $f : \R \to \R$ such that for all $a,b \in \R$, $\fof{a + b} = \fof{a} \fof{b}$? It would then be possible to construct a new sequence from an existing sequence by applying $f$ to every term. Furthermore, if it is possible to invert such an $f$, then it would be possible to convert multiplication back to addition.
    \end{hint}
\end{enumerate}
\end{boxhexercise}

\begin{remark}
    Usually, in the IB, we deal only with ``interesting'' geometric sequences. That is, $r$ is usually taken to not be equal to $0$, $1$ or $-1$. However, personally, I find these cases to be more interesting...
\end{remark}

In terms of exams, one can expect to see similar types of questions for arithmetic and geometric sequences.
\begin{boxexample}
    Let $\an$ be a geometric sequence with common ratio $r$. Given that $a_2 = 10$ and $a_5 = 80$, find $a_7$.
    \begin{solution}
        Since $a_5$ is $5 - 2 = 3$ terms away from $a_2$, one needs to multiply $a_2$ by $r$ \textit{thrice} to get from $a_2$ to $a_5$. In mathematical terms, we have
        \begin{align*}
            && a_5 &= a_2 \cdot r \cdot r \cdot r &&& \\
            &\iff& r^3 &= \frac{80}{10} = 8 &&& \\
            &\ergo& r &= \cbrt{8} = 2
        \end{align*}
        Therefore, since $a_7$ is $7 - 5 = 2$ terms after $a_5$, we have
        \begin{align*}
            a_7 &= a_5 \cdot r^2 \\
            &= 80 \times 4 = 320
        \end{align*}
        \vspace{-2em}
    \end{solution}
\end{boxexample}

It turns out that things can get slightly more complicated if you are given two terms that are an even number of terms apart.

\begin{boxexercise}
    Let $\an$ be a geometric sequence. In each of the following cases, find the common ratio and the first term.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{boxexercise}
