\section{Arithmetic Sequences}

\subsection{What is an Arithmetic Sequence?}

\begin{definition}[Arithmetic Sequence]
    We say that a sequence $\parenth{a_n}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is an \textbf{arithmetic sequence} if there is some number $d$, known as the \textbf{common difference}, such that for all $n \in \N$,
    \begin{align}
        a_{n+1} &= a_n + d
    \end{align}
    In other words, adding $d$ to any term in the sequence gives the next term.
\end{definition}

\begin{boxexercise}[An Equivalent Characterisation]
Let $\an$ be an arithmetic sequence. Show that the $n$th term $a_n$ of the sequence is given by
\begin{align}
    a_n = a_1 + d \cdot \parenth{n - 1} \label{eq:AS_nth_term}
\end{align}
\end{boxexercise}

\subsection{Examples of Arithmetic Sequences}

Arithmetic sequences appear everywhere, and we are already used to working with them, even if we may not realise it.

\begin{example}
We already know of the following arithmetic sequences:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item The sequence natural numbers $1,2,3,4,5,6,\ldots$ form an arithmetic sequence with first term $1$ and common difference $1$.\footnote{Formally speaking, this isn't quite true: the sequence itself is the \textit{map} $a_n = n$ that corresponds to the trivial inclusion map from $\N$ to $\R$ that sends every element of $\N$ to itself. We have essentially identified each sequence with its elements, as we are more interested in those than the maps themselves.}
    \item The two-times-table $2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, \ldots$ is an arithmetic sequence with first term $2$ and common difference $2$. Indeed, an analogous result is true for \textit{any} multiplication table.
    \item The odd numbers $1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, \ldots$ is also an arithmetic sequence with first term $1$ and common difference $2$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}

Given two terms of an arithmetic sequence, it is easy to compute the common difference $d$ by looking at the \textbf{number of differences} separating the two terms. For example:

\begin{boxexample}
Let $\an$ be an arithmetic sequence with $a_2 = 5$ and $a_5 = 14$. Find the common difference of the sequence.
\begin{solution}
Since $a_2$ and $a_5$ are $5 - 2 = 3$ terms apart, adding $d$ to $a_2$ three times should give $a_5$. In other words,
\begin{align*}
    5 + 3d &= 14 \\
    \iff \quad \quad \quad \quad d &= \frac{14 - 5}{3} \\
    &= 3
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
\vspace{-3em}
\end{boxexample}

Try the following yourself.

\begin{boxexercise}
Let $\an$ be an arithmetic sequence. In each of the following cases, find the common difference and the first term.
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item $a_5 = 10$, $a_{45} = 90$
    \item $a_3 = 2$, $a_7 = 4$
    \item $a_{365} = 364$, $a_{1001001} = 1001000$
\end{enumerate}
\end{boxexercise}

\subsection{Sum of $n$ Terms of an Arithmetic Sequence}

It turns out that there is a rather ingenious trick to sum the first $n$ terms of an arithmetic sequence. Consider the following example to compute the first $100$ terms of $1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots$ (ie, the natural numbers), an arithmetic sequence with first term $1$ and difference $1$.

\begin{boxexample}[Gauss] \label{eg:Gauss_sum}
    It is said that the renowned German mathematician, Carl Friedrich Gauss, came up with the following trick as a child when his teacher asked him to add the first $100$ natural numbers as a punishment for misbehaving in class. \\

    He first wrote down the numbers like so:
    \begin{align*}
        \begin{matrix}
            S & = & 1 & + & 2 & + & 3 & + & \cdots & + & 98 & + & 99 & + & 100
        \end{matrix}
    \end{align*}
    Then, he wrote another copy below, like so:
    \begin{align*}
        \begin{matrix}
            S & = & 1 & + & 2 & + & 3 & + & \cdots & + & 98 & + & 99 & + & 100 \\
            S & = & 100 & + & 99 & + & 98 & + & \cdots & + & 3 & + & 2 & + & 1
        \end{matrix}
    \end{align*}
    Then, he added the numbers column-wise:
    \begin{align*}
        \begin{matrix}
            S & = & 1 & + & 2 & + & 3 & + & \cdots & + & 98 & + & 99 & + & 100 \\
            S & = & 100 & + & 99 & + & 98 & + & \cdots & + & 3 & + & 2 & + & 1 \\
            \hline
            2S & = & 101 & + & 101 & + & 101 & + & \cdots & + & 101 & + & 101 & + & 101
        \end{matrix}
    \end{align*}
    In other words, $2S = 101 \times 100$, meaning $S = 5050$.
\end{boxexample}

The heart and soul of Gauss's argument is the fact that these ``complementary terms'' $1$ and $100$, $2$ and $99$, and so on---that is, $j$ and $n - j + 1$ for every $j \in \N$ with $1 \leq j \leq 100$---add up to the same number, namely $101$. It turns out that a similar result is true of \textit{all} arithmetic sequences, allowing us to generalise Gauss's argument.

\begin{boxexercise}\label{ex:AS_first_pl_last}
    Let $\an$ be an arithmetic sequence and let $n$ be any natural number. Show that for any $j \in \N$ such that $1 \leq j \leq n$,
    \begin{align}
        a_j + a_{n-j+1} &= a_1 + a_n \label{eq:AS_first_pl_last}
    \end{align}

    \begin{remark}
        While this is easily proved by substituting appropriately into the formula \eqref{eq:AS_nth_term}, it is instructive to instead think about the equivalent statement
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{a_j + a_{n-j+1}}{2} &= \frac{a_1 + a_n}{2} \label{eq:AS_first_pl_last}
    \end{align*}
    This result is obvious when $a_n = n$, ie, when you just think about the $j$th and $\parenth{n-j+1}$th natural numbers instead of those terms in the sequence. It is precisely the arithmeticity of the sequence that allows us to use the natural number formulation and the sequence formulation interchangeably---in this case, at least.
    \end{remark}
\end{boxexercise}

We therefore have the following result:
\begin{theorem}
Let $\an$ be an arithmetic sequence. Let
\begin{align}
    S_n &:= \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_j
\end{align}
denote the sum of the first $n$ terms of $\an$---in other words, $S_n = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_n$. Then, we have
\begin{align}
    S_n &= \frac{n}{2}\parenth{a_1 + a_n} \label{eq:AS_sum_form}
\end{align}
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    We use the same argument as Example \ref{eg:Gauss_sum}:
    \begin{align*}
    \begin{matrix}
        S_n & = & a_1 & + & a_2 & + & \cdots &  + & a_{n-1} & + & a_n \\
        S_n & = & a_n & + & a_{n-1} & + & \cdots & + & a_2 & + & a_1 \\
        \hline
        2S_n & = & \parenth{a_1 + a_n} & + & \parenth{a_1 + a_n} & + & \cdots & + & \parenth{a_1 + a_n} & + & \parenth{a_1 + a_n}
    \end{matrix}
    \end{align*}
    where the last line follows from Exercise \ref{ex:AS_first_pl_last}.
    
    Therefore,
    \begin{align*}
        2S_n &= n\parenth{a_1 + a_n} \\
        \iff \quad \quad S_n &= \frac{n}{2}\parenth{a_1 + a_n}
    \end{align*}
    as required.
\end{proof}
Hereafter, we will discard the summation notation and instead use $S_n$ to denote the sum of the first $n$ terms of a given sequence.

Sometimes, we do not know what the $n$th term of some sequence is. Therefore, the following equivalent formula, which is easily derived, is quite useful.
\begin{boxexercise}[An Equivalent Formula]
Let $\an$ be an arithmetic sequence with common difference $d$. Then,
\begin{align}
    S_n &= \frac{n}{2}\parenth{2a_1 + d\parenth{n-1}}
\end{align}
\end{boxexercise}
Once one gets more comfortable with arithmetic sequences, one will start seeing patterns more intuitively, and be able to add up terms more easily. The key for this is, of course, \textbf{practice}.
\begin{boxexercise}
    Let $\an$ be an arithmetic sequence. In each of the following cases, find the sum of the first $n$ terms.
    \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
        \item $a_1 = 20$, $d = 3$, $n = 10$
        \item $a_1 = 3$, $a_6 = 101$, $n = 6$
        \item $a_5 = 49$, $a_{7} = 51$, $n = 11$
        \item $a_4 = 14$, $a_6 = 22$, $n = 15$
    \end{enumerate}
    \begin{hint}
        The formula \eqref{eq:AS_sum_form} can be rewritten as
        \begin{align*}
            S_n &= n\parenth{\frac{a_1 + a_n}{2}}   
        \end{align*}
        Is this a more helpful form? Think about the quantity in parentheses.
    \end{hint}
\end{boxexercise}

We are now ready to move onto Geometric Sequences.
